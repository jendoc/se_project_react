## Description

Created for Practicum USA Software Engineering Bootcamp. This project is my first experience with React. The app fetchs data from [Open Weather Map's API](https://openweathermap.org/api) according to a set latitude and longitude. This data then dynamicaly styles the app's appearance and filters uploaded clothing based on the weather.
